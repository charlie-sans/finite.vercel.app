# MicroASM Instruction Set Documentation

This document details all instructions available in the MicroASM language.

all instructions are case-insensitive, so `MOV` is the same as `mov`
arguments however are case-sensitive, so `MOV R1 r2` is not the same as `MOV R1 R2`

## Registers
- RAX
- RBX
- RCX
- RDX
- RSI
- RDI
- RBP
- RSP
- RIP (Instruction Pointer, though you shouldn't use this besides reading it and maybe comparing it? or using it as a jump destination)
- R0 -> 15 (General Purpose Registers, use as you wish, but be careful with RSP and RBP. allways push and pop in pairs, and allways pop in the reverse order you pushed) don't be like me and forget to pop the registers you pushed, or you'll have a bad time


## Basic Instructions

### MOV (Move)

```
MOV dest, src
```

Copies a value from the source to the destination register.
Example: `MOV R1 R2` - Copies value from R2 to R1

### ADD (Addition)

```
ADD dest src
```

Adds the source value to the destination register and stores the result in the destination.
Example: `ADD R1 R2` - R1 = R1 + R2

### SUB (Subtraction)

```
SUB dest src
```

Subtracts the source value from the destination register and stores the result in the destination.
Example: `SUB R1 R2` - R1 = R1 - R2

### MUL (Multiplication)

```
MUL dest src
```

Multiplies the destination register by the source value and stores the result in the destination.
Example: `MUL R1 R2` - R1 = R1 * R2

### DIV (Division)

```
DIV dest src
```

Divides the destination register by the source value and stores the result in the destination.
Example: `DIV R1 R2` - R1 = R1 / R2

### INC (Increment)

```
INC dest
```

Increments the value in the destination register by 1.
Example: `INC R1` - R1 = R1 + 1

## Flow Control

### JMP (Jump)

```
JMP label
```

Unconditionally jumps to the specified label.
Example: `JMP #loop` - Jumps to label 'loop'

### CMP (Compare)

```
CMP dest, src
```

Compares two values and sets internal flags for conditional jumps.
Example: `CMP R1 R2` - Compares R1 with R2

### JE (Jump if Equal)

```
JE label_true label_false
```

Jumps to label_true if the previous comparison was equal, otherwise jumps to label_false.
Example: `JE #equal #not_equal`

### JL (Jump if Less)

```
JL label
```

Jumps to the specified label if the previous comparison result was "less than".
Example: `JL #less`

### CALL (Call Function)

```
CALL label
```

Calls a function at the specified label.
Example: `CALL #function`
or calls external code if not marked with a #
Example: `CALL $function`
## Stack Operations

### PUSH

```
PUSH src
```

Pushes a value onto the stack.
Example: `PUSH R1`

### POP

```
POP dest
```

Pops a value from the stack into the destination register.
Example: `POP R1`

## I/O Operations

### OUT

```
OUT port value
```

Outputs a value or string (prefixed with $) to 1. stdout, 2. stderr with a newline.
Example: `OUT 2 R1` or `OUT 1 $500`

### COUT

```
COUT port value
```

Outputs a single character value to stdout folowing the ASCII table and OUT rules.
Example: `COUT 1 R1` or `COUT 2 $65`

## Program Control

### HLT (Halt)

```
HLT
```

Stops program execution and returns to the operating system.

### EXIT

```
EXIT code
```

Exits the program with the specified return code.
Example: `EXIT R1`

## Command Line Arguments

### ARGC

```
ARGC dest
```

Gets the count of command line arguments into the destination register.
Example: `ARGC R1`

### GETARG

```
GETARG dest index
```

Gets the command line argument at the specified index into the destination register.
Example: `GETARG R1 R2`

in jmasm, the index is 0-based and comes after the launched program name, unlike how csharp wants -- --<argument> or -<argument> or <argument> to be the passing to the program

## Data Definition

### DB (Define Bytes)

```
DB address "string"
```

Defines a string constant at the specified address.
Example: `DB $1 "Hello, World!"` (using $ prefix)

## Labels

### LBL (Label)

```
LBL name
```

Defines a label that can be jumped to.
Example: `LBL loop`

## Notes

- Registers are referenced as R0, R1, R2, etc.
- String constants can be defined using DB and referenced with a $ prefix
- Labels are referenced with a # prefix in jump instructions
- All numeric values are treated as 64-bit integers
