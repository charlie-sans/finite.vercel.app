you might be wondering what all those spec.meta files are.

in order to display infomation about what tags there are, how long it will take to read,
when did we change it last.

it all comes from .spec/.json files stored in the directory where we serve the files.


now, these files shouldn't be viewable by normal people and should be hidden by default.
